🐛 Troubleshooting
ML Service Issues
Issue: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'basic_pitch'
bash# Solution: Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Issue: numpy version conflict
bash# Solution: Install exact versions
pip install numpy==1.24.3
Issue: Audio analysis returns empty notes
bash# Possible causes:
# - Audio file is too quiet (normalize audio)
# - File format not supported (convert to WAV)
# - File is corrupted (try different file)
Frontend Issues
Issue: Cannot connect to backend
bash# Solution: Check if backend is running
# Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in .env.local
